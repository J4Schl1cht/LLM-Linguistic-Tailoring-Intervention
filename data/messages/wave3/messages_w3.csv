108267.0,"Hiya! I’m Sasha, nice to meet you! Over the next two weeks, we’ll explore healthy and sustainable eating together.

A year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and learned loads along the way. It’s not about being perfect; I don’t think we all need to go completely vegan. But, being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet.

Stay tuned, as I’ll share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference.","Fruits and vegetables are filled with important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. For instance, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could also talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together, have you got any favourite ones?","Reducing how much meat we eat can help save loads of CO2, which causes climate change. For example, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China… and back! Brilliant, with small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others! Let’s start small; for example, we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Do you know how much that helps?","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. Factory farms keep going because people buy their products. By choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.","Fibre is really important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and its only found in plants, not in animal foods. When we have enough fibre in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, avoiding that tired feeling after lunch.

Changing our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first. An easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon, yeah?","80% of young people think living sustainably is really important for their happiness. And 77% say they'd go for meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle, yeah? Brilliant to see how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not trying to be completely vegan, we all can do something to help, you know? Like, we can try the plant-based options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. 😄

I'm excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favourite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part.

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future!

Why not see if any of your favourite celebrities also eat plant-based?","Reducing meat, dairy, and sugary foods can really help improve acne (up to 87% less acne in young people). Eating lots of vegetables and fruits keeps our skin hydrated, protects from sunburn, and even stops wrinkles.

Brilliant, having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually buy food during your day? Any tasty plant-based options you could try next time you have a choice?","If everyone ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change.

Climate change will mostly affect us young people cos we will see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, lets look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do.

Do you know which foods are especially harmful for the climate? Hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’.","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives, never see sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. Ok, thats great. We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. This is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better.","Veggies and fruits have these brilliant plant things that help our brain be healthy and work well. Just adding a few more veggies, like three extra bits each week, can boost our mood and make us happier. No limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! You could challenge yourself, your mates, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with a cheeky cheat day here and there).","Animal farming, it's why 80% of the Amazon rainforest is gone, you know? Farmers need space for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland together. Imagine if there were no trees left here!!! Brilliant, by eating less meat, like veggie burgers for lunch, we can make a difference. If you eat with others, you can set an example, inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too."

But, being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet.Stay tuned, because Iâ€™ll be sharing lots of interesting science facts and giving you tips for small changes that can make a big difference. ðŸŒ±","So, you know how fruits and veggies are packed with all those important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants? They help our bodies fight diseases. For instance, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall.Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could also chat with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together, what do you think?","So, here's the thing, if we cut down on our meat intake, we can save a ton of CO2, right? Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it's like driving a car from London to China and back! Isn't that crazy? With small changes like this, everyone can do their part for the environment and slow down climate change now, no need to wait for others!

But if we choose to eat less meat or go for plant-based options when we can, we're telling them to improve conditions for those animals.","So, what's the deal with fiber? It's super important for our stomachs, right? And guess what, you can only find it in plants, not animal foods. When we load up on fiber, we stay full longer and have way more energy for the school day. No more of that tired feeling after lunch, you know?

Changing habits, like what we eat, can be a bit tricky at first. But hey, why not start with something easy? Like trying more plant-based lunches at school. That way, you'll feel more energetic and ready to tackle the afternoon.","So, 80% of young people think living sustainably is super important for their happiness, right? And like, 77% are down to try meat alternatives for that sustainable life. 

It's awesome how much our generation is on the same page about this. Even if we're not going full vegan, we can all do our part. Like, we can give those plant-based options in our school cafeteria a shot or swap in some meat alternatives more often. 😊","Hey!

A year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and learned a lot along the way. It’s not about being perfect; I don’t think we all need to go completely vegan. But being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet.

Stay tuned, as I’ll share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference. What do you think?","Fruits and vegetables are filled with important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. For instance, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. Every time you buy food yourself, you get to decide what goes into your body. To make it more fun, you could also talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together. What do you think?","Cutting down on meat can save loads of CO2, which is good for climate change. Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China... and back! 

With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now, no need to wait for others! Let’s start small, like eating meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. What do you think?","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. Factory farms keep going because people buy their products. By choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals. What do you think?","Fiber is really important to keep our stomachs healthy, and you only find it in plants, not in animal foods. When we have enough fiber in our meals, we stay full longer and have more energy for the school day, so no more tired feeling after lunch.

Changing habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first. An easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon. What do you think?","80% of young people think living sustainably is really important for their happiness. And 77% say they would pick meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle.

It's great to see how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not trying to be completely vegan, each of us can do something to help. For example, we can try the plant-based food options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often. What do you think?","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week.\n\nI'm excited to see how more people are choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favourite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part.\n\nI also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere.  It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future!\n\nWhy not see if some of your favorite celebrities also eat plant-based? ","Reducing how much meat, dairy, and sugary foods we eat can really help improve acne (up to 87% less acne in young people). Eating lots of vegetables and fruits also keeps our skin hydrated, protects us from getting sunburned, and even stops wrinkles.\n\nHaving clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually buy food during your day? Are there tasty plant-based options you could try the next time you have a choice?","If everyone ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change.\n\nClimate change will mostly affect us young people because we will see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do.\n\nYou can also find out which foods are especially harmful for to climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives and never see sunlight.

But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. This is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better.","Vegetables and fruits have helpful plant substances that support our brain health and help it work well.

There's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains!

But by eating less meat, like choosing veggie burgers instead of regular burgers for lunch, we can make a difference without needing to change much. If you eat with others, you can also set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too. 🙏"
108300.0,"Hey! I'm Sasha, nice to meet u! Over the next 2 weeks, I'm gonna explore healthy and sustainable eating with u. 🍎 

So like a year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and learned lots along the way. It's not about being perfect, I don't think we all need to go completely vegan. But like, being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet, ya know? 🌍 

So stay tuned, coz I'm gonna share lots of interesting science facts and give u tips for small changes that can make a big difference. 👍","Yea fruits and veg are filled with important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. Like people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits. Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, u could also talk with ur friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together lol","Yea reducing how much meat we eat can save loads of CO2 which causes climate change. Like if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China and back! With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others! Let’s start small, like we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. Factory farms keep going because people buy their products. By choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.","Fiber is like really important for our stomachs and stuff, it's only in plants not animal foods. When we have enough fiber we stay full for ages and have more energy for school, no more tired feeling after lunch lol.

Changing what we eat and stuff can be tricky at first. But like an easy way to start is try more plant lunches at school, feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon ya know?","Yea so 80% of young ppl think living sustainable is really important for happiness. And 77% say they'd choose meat alternatives for sustainable lifestyle.

Nice to see how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not trying to be fully vegan, we can all do something to help. Like we can try plant-based food in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. I'm excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my fav celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part. I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future! Why not see if some of ur fav celebrities also eat plant-based?","Yea so eating less meat, dairy, and sugary stuff can help with acne, like up to 87% less for young people. Plus, lots of veggies and fruits keep skin hydrated, protect from sunburn, and even stop wrinkles.

Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do u usually buy food during your day? Are there any tasty plant-based options u could try next time u have a choice?","If everyone ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change.

Climate change will mostly affect us young people cuz we will see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do.

Yea you can also find out which foods are especially harmful for the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives and never see sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. Yea we may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. This is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better.","Veggies and fruits have stuff that helps our brains and makes them work well. Just adding a few more veggies (like 3 extra servings each week) can already boost our mood and make us happier.

There's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains!

stay tuned,as i will share lots of interesting science facts and give u tips for small changes that can make a big difference.","fruits and vegetables are filled with important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases,dont u think? for instance, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. to make it more fun, you could also talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together,i can imagine.","reducing how much meat we eat can save a lot of co2, u know the stuff thats causing climate change. like if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, its like driving a car from london to china and back! wow, right? with small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now, dont u think? lets start small, like try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch and dinner.","more than 70% of farm animals in the uk are raised on factory farms to keep animal products cheap,dont u think? on these farms,a chicken has only about the space of a laptop,so theres hardly any room to move. its like living under a staircase,like harry potter,for ur whole life.

changing our habits,like what we eat,can be tricky at first. an easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon,dont u think?","80% of young people believe that living sustainably is very important for their happiness,dont u think? and 77% say they would choose meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle. its good to see how much our generation agrees on this. even if we're not trying to be completely vegan,each of us can do something to help. for example,we can try the plant-based food options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","hey! thanks for following along for the first week, 
i am excited to see more people are choosing plant-based eating, 
some of my fav celebrities eat vegan, like lewis hamilton, billie eilish, and ariana grande. others, like harry styles and lionel messi, avoid animal products for the most part.

To make it more fun, you could also talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together.","Reducing how much meat we eat can help save a lot of CO2, which causes climate change.

By choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.","Fiber is really important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and it's only found in plants, not in animal foods. When we have enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, avoiding that tired feeling after lunch.\n\nChanging our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first.

every time we buy food ourselves we get to decide what goes into our bodies. to make it more fun u could also talk with ur friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together","like reducing how much meat we eat can save a lot of co2 which causes climate change and stuff. if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, its like driving a car from london to china and back lol. with small changes like this everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others. lets start small, like we can try to eat meat only once a day instead of having it at breakfast lunch and dinner.","more than 70% of farm animals in the uk are raised on factory farms to keep animal products cheap. on these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so theres hardly any room to move. its like living under a staircase like harry potter for ur whole life.

factory farms keep going bc people buy their products. by choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals or smth",fiber is rly important for keeping our stomachs healthy and its only in plants not in like animal foods. when we have enough fiber we stay full for longer and have more energy during school so we dont get that tired feeling after lunch. changing habits like what we eat can be tricky at first. an easy way to start is to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon.,"like 80% of young people think living sustainably is really important for their happiness n stuff. and 77% say theyd choose meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle or whatever

i mean its good to see how much our generation agrees on this. even if were not trying to be completely vegan, each of us can do smth to help. like we can try the plant-based food options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often","hey! so thanks for following along for the first week. i’m kinda excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. some of my fave celebs eat vegan, like lewis hamilton, billie eilish, and ariana grande. others like harry styles and lionel messi avoid animal products for the most part. i also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. it looks like we’ll have lots of options in the future! why not see if some of ur fave celebs also eat plant-based?","like reducing how much meat, dairy, and sugary foods we eat can really help with acne, like up to 87% less acne in young people. eating lots of vegetables and fruits also keeps our skin hydrated, protects us from getting sunburned, and even stops wrinkles.

idk but having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. when do u usually buy food during ur day? are there any tasty plant-based options u could try next time u have a choice?","if everyone ate less animal foods the co2 from food production would drop by like 68%. just by changing our food choices we could be halfway to stopping climate change.

it mostly affects us young people coz we will see it in our lifetime. instead of being cynical lets look for small effective changes we can make right now. choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do.

idk u can also find out which foods are especially harmful to the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).",most pigs and chickens in the uk are kept indoors their whole lives and never see sunlight. animals that cant go outside are more stressed and scientists say much less happy. we may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly but we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives like plant-based schnitzel sausages and burgers instead of animal meat. this is the quickest way to help make animals lives better.,"veggies and fruits have like helpful plant stuff that support our brain health and help it work well. just adding a few more veggies (like three extra servings each week) can already boost our mood and make us happier no lie.

theres no limit to how many plants we can eat—its all good for our brains! to start, u could challenge urself, ur friends, or ur parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there).","animal farming is like responsible for 80% of the amazon rainforest loss cuz farmers need space for cattle and cattle food. last year, the amazon lost as many trees as there are in the uk and ireland combined. omg imagine if there were no trees left here!

if we eat less meat tho (like choosing veggie burgers instead of regular ones for lunch), we can make a difference without much change. if u eat with others, u can set an example and inspire ur friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too."

It’s not about being perfect; I don’t think we all need to go completely vegan. However, being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet.\n\nStay tuned, as I will share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference.","Fruits and vegetables are filled with important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. For instance, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall.\n\nEvery time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could also talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together.","Reducing how much meat we eat can help save a lot of CO2, which causes climate change. For example, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China… and back!\n\nWith small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others! Let’s start small;  for example, we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life.\n\nFactory farms keep going because people buy their products. By choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.","Fiber is really important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and it's only found in plants, not in animal foods. When we have enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, avoiding that tired feeling after lunch.\n\nChanging our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first. An easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon.","80% of young people believe that living sustainably is very important for their happiness. And 77% say they would choose meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle.\n\nIt's good to see how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not trying to be completely vegan, each of us can do something to help. For example, we can try the plant-based food options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. I'm so excited to see how more people are choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favourite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part. I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future! Why not see if some of your favourite celebrities also eat plant-based?","Ok, so reducing how much meat, dairy, and sugary foods we eat can really help improve acne, like up to 87% less acne in young people. Eating lots of vegetables and fruits also keeps our skin hydrated, protects us from getting sunburned, and even stops wrinkles. So having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually buy food during your day? And are there tasty plant-based options you could try the next time you have a choice?","Ok, so if everyone ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change.

I mean, climate change will mostly affect us young people because we will see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do, right?

And you can also find out which foods are especially harmful for the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","Ok, so most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives and never see sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. This is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better, right?","Ok, so veggies and fruits have these helpful plant things that are good for our brains and make them work well. Just adding a few more veggies, like three extra bits each week, can already boost our mood and make us feel happier. There's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! To start, you could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there).","Ok, so animal farming is like responsible for 80% of the amazon rainforest loss, coz they need space for cattle and their food. Last year, the amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland together. Imagine if there were no trees left here!But if we eat less meat, like choosing veggie burgers for lunch, we can make a difference without much change.

Easy start is more plant lunches in school, feel more ready for afternoon. 🍴","So 80% of young ppl think living sustainably is like super important for their happiness. And 77% say they'd go for meat alternatives for that sustainable life. 👍

It's kinda cool how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not trying to be all vegan, each of us can do something to help. Like we can try plant-based stuff in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often. 🌱","Hi! Thx for following along for the first week. 😁

I'm excited to see more ppl choosing plant-based eating. Some of my faves like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, & Ariana Grande eat vegan. Others like Harry Styles & Lionel Messi avoid animal products for the most part.

I also see new plant-based products & restaurants everywhere. Looks like we'll have lots of options in the future! 🌱

Why not see if some of ur fave celebrities also eat plant-based? 🤔","So, cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary stuff can like really help with acne. Up to 87% less acne for young peeps! Plus, eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps skin hydrated, protects from sunburn, and even stops wrinkles. 🍎

Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do u usually buy food during your day? Any tasty plant-based stuff u could try next time? 🤔","If everyone ate less animal foods, CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change. 🌱

Climate change will mostly affect us young people 'cause we'll see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do. 🍴

U can also find out which foods are especially harmful for the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’). 🤔","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives and never see sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. So u might not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But u can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. That's the quickest way to help make animals' lives better.","Veggies & fruits got helpful stuff that's good for our brain & makes it work well. Just add a few more veggies (like 3 extra each week) & it can boost our mood & make us happier. 😃

No limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! To start, u could challenge yourself, friends, or parents to have more plant-based meals on some days (with an occasional cheat day here & there). 👍","So, animal farming is why 80% of the Amazon rainforest is gone. Farmers need space for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Imagine if there were no trees left here! Haha, not good.

But hey, by eating less meat (like choosing veggie burgers instead of regular ones for lunch), we can make a difference without much change. If u eat with others, u can set an example and inspire friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too. 👍"

Animals that can't go outside are more stressed, scientists say much less happy. Yp, we may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. This is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better.","Veggies and fruits have stuff that's great for our brains and helps them work well. Just add a few more veggies (like three extra servings each week), and it can boost our mood and make us happier :)No limit to how many plants we can eatâ€”it's all good for our brains! You could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there).","Yp, animal farming's responsible for 80% of the Amazon rainforest loss, 'cause farmers need space for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Imagine if there weren't a single tree left here! :(

Stay tuned, cause I’m gonna share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference.","Fruits and vegetables have like important nutrients, you know like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. I mean those who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could also chat with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together. What do you think?","So like, reducing how much meat we eat can really help save a lot of CO2, you know the stuff that causes climate change. Like if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China… and back! Crazy right?

With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others! Let’s start small, like we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. What do you think?","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms just to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. 

Factory farms keep going because people buy their products. By choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals. What do you think?","Fiber is like really important to keep our stomachs healthy, it's only in plants, not animal foods. When we got enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for way longer and got more energy for school, no more feeling tired after lunch.

Changing what we eat and stuff can be tricky at first. But like an easy way to start is try more plant-based lunches at school, feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon, you know?","Like 80% of young people feel that living sustainably is very important for their happiness. And 77% say they would choose meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle ya know. Its good to see how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not trying to be completely vegan, each of us can do something to help. Like we can try the plant-based food options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. I am excited to see how more people are choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favourite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part. I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we will have lots of options in the future! Why not see if some of your favourite celebrities also eat plant-based?","So like, reducing how much meat, dairy, and sugary foods we eat can really help with acne, like up to 87% less for young people. Eating lots of vegetables and fruits also keeps our skin hydrated, protects us from getting sunburned, and even stops wrinkles. I mean, having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually buy food during your day? Are there tasty plant-based options you could try the next time you have a choice?","If we all ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change.

Climate change will mostly affect us young people cos we will see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, lets look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do.

You can also find out which foods are especially harmful for the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives, never see sunlight. Animals that cant go outside are more stressed and scientists say much less happy.

We cant really change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers instead of animal meat. Its the quickest way to help make animals lives better. What do you think?","Veggies and fruits have like these helpful things that support our brains and make them work well. Just adding a few more veggies, like three extra bits a week, can boost our mood and make us feel happier. No limit to how many plants we can eat, it's all good for our brains! You could challenge yourself, your friends, or your family to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week, with like an occasional cheat day here and there. What do you think?","Animal farming is why we lost 80% of the Amazon rainforest, they need space for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as the UK and Ireland have together. Imagine if there were no trees left here! By eating less meat, like having veggie burgers for lunch, we can make a difference without much change. If you eat with others, you can set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too."
