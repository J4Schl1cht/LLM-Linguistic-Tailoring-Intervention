Like, a year ago, I started eating more plant-based stuff and learned a bunch along the way. It's not about being perfect; I don't think we all need to go full vegan. But, being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet, you know?

Stay tuned, 'cause I'll share lots of cool science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference. 💪","Fruits and veggies are packed with important stuff like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. Like I said, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. Every time we buy food, we decide what goes into our bodies. To make it fun, you could talk with your friends during lunch and try some plant-based foods together, you get my point?","Reducing meat we eat can save CO2, helps with climate change. Like if we eat meat every other day for a year, it's like driving from London to China and back! Small changes, everyone helps the environment. Let's start small, eat meat once a day, not breakfast, lunch, and dinner.","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are on factory farms to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has like the space of a laptop, hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase like Harry Potter your whole life. Factory farms keep going because we buy their products. If we choose to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we send a message for better living conditions, you get my point","Fiber is important for our stomachs, it's in plants not animal foods. When we have enough fiber, we stay full longer and more energy for school, no tired feeling after lunch. Changing habits like what we eat can be tricky. Easy way to start, try plant-based lunches at school, feel more energetic for the afternoon.","80% of young people say living sustainably is really important for happiness. And 77% like meat alternatives for that sustainable life. I mean it's good we agree on this. Even if we're not going full vegan, we can do something. Like trying those plant-based options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives, you get my point.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. 🌱

I like seeing more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favourite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part.

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future! 🍔

Why not see if some of your favourite celebrities also eat plant-based?","Cutting down on meat, dairy, sugary stuff we eat can really help with acne, like up to 87% less acne in young people. Eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps skin hydrated, protects from sunburn, even stops wrinkles 🍎🥦

Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually get your food? Any tasty plant-based stuff you could try next time?","If everyone ate less animal foods, CO2 from food would drop by 68%. Just by changing what we eat, we'd be halfway to stopping climate change. 🌎

Climate change hits us young people the most, we'll see it in our lifetime. Instead of being all negative, let's find small changes we can do now. Choosing more plant-based stuff is an easy one.

You can also check which foods are bad for the climate, hint: the worst farm animal rhymes with 'wow'.","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives, never see sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, way less happy. We can't change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers instead of animal meat. It's the quickest way to help make animals' lives better, if you get my point.","Veggies and fruits got good stuff for our brains, makes it work better. Just add some more veggies, like three more each week, can boost mood, make us happier. No limit to plants we can eat, all good for brains! You could challenge yourself, friends, or parents, more plant-based meals some days, cheat day here and there. 🍎🥦","Animal farming is bad for Amazon, like 80% of loss is because of cattle and their food. Last year, Amazon lost lots of trees, like all trees in UK and Ireland together. Imagine no trees left! 🌳🌳 By eating less meat, like veggie burgers for lunch, we can make a difference.

I'm glad to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my fave celebs eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part. 

I also notice new plant-based products and restaurants popping up everywhere. Looks like we'll have lots of options in the future! 

Just curious though, why not check if some of your fave celebs also eat plant-based?","So cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary stuff can like really help with acne, up to 87% less for young peeps. Plus, lots of veggies and fruits keep skin hydrated, protects from sunburn, and even stops wrinkles.

A year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and learned a lot along the way. It's not about being perfect; I don't think we all need to go completely vegan. But, being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet.

Stay tuned, as I'll share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference. What about you? Have you tried plant-based foods?","Hi, Panda. Fruits and vegetables are packed with important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. For instance, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall.

Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, what about trying out some plant-based foods with your friends during lunch?","Hi, reducing how much meat we eat can help save lots of CO2, which causes climate change. For instance, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China... and back! With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others! Let's start small; for example, we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. What about you?","Hi, did you know more than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms just to keep animal products cheap? On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. Sad, isn't it? But these farms keep going because people buy their products. So, what about choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can? That way, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals. What do you think?","Hi, Panda. Fiber is really important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and it's only found in plants, not in animal foods. When we have enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, avoiding that tired feeling after lunch. What about you? Do you have enough fiber in your meals?

Changing our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first. An easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon.

Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and scientists say they're much less happy. We can't change how animals are treated on these farms directly, but we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives, like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers instead of animal meat. That's the quickest way to help make animals' lives better.","Veggies and fruits have these cool plant things that help our brains and make them work better. Just adding a few more veggies, like three extra servings a week, can boost our mood and make us happier. 😃

There's no limit to how many plants we can eat, it's all good for our brains! You could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week, with an occasional cheat day here and there. 😉","Animal farming is why 80% of the Amazon rainforest is gone, they need space for cattle and cattle food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland together. Imagine if there were no trees left here! But if we eat less meat, like choosing veggie burgers for lunch, we can make a difference. If you eat with others, you can set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too."

You can also find out which foods are especially harmful for to climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives never see sunlight. Animals that cant go outside are more stressed n scientists say much less happy.

We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables n meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, n burgers) instead of animal meat. This is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better.","Veggies and fruits got good stuff for our brains and help it work right. Just add a few more veggies like 3 more a week and it can boost our mood and make us happier. 

No limit on how many plants we can eat its all good for our brains! U could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant meals some days of the week (with a cheat day here and there).","Animal farming is why 80% of the amazon rainforest is gone, they need space for cattle and cattle food. Last year, the amazon lost as many trees as there are in the uk and ireland together. Imagine if there were no trees left here! haha

A year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and learned a lot along the way. It's not about being perfect; I don't think we all need to go completely vegan. But being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet.

Stay tuned, as I'll share lots of interesting science facts and give u tips for small changes that can make a big difference.","Fruits and veggies are packed with important stuff like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. Like, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. Every time we buy food, we decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, u could talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together.","Reducing how much meat we eat can help save lots of CO2, which causes climate change. Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China... and back! With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others! Let's start small; like, we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. Factory farms keep going because people buy their products. By choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.","Fibre is rly important for keeping our stomachs healthy, & it's only found in plants, not in animal foods. When we have enough fibre in our meals, we stay full for longer & have more energy throughout the school day, avoiding that tired feeling after lunch.

Changing our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first. An easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic & ready for the afternoon.","80% of young people believe that living sustainably is very important for their happiness. And 77% say they would choose meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle.

It's good to see how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not trying to be completely vegan, each of us can do something to help. For example, we can try the plant-based food options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. 🎉

I'm excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favourite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part. 🌱

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future! 🍔

Why not see if some of your favourite celebrities also eat plant-based? 🤔","Cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary foods can really help with acne (like up to 87% less for young people). Eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps our skin hydrated, protects from sunburn, and even stops wrinkles. Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do u usually buy food during your day?

115513,"Hey! I’m Sasha, nice to meet you! So over the next two weeks, I'll be exploring healthy and sustainable eating with you.  

About a year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and learned a lot along the way. It’s not about being perfect; I don’t think we all need to go completely vegan. But being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet.  

Stay tuned, I'll share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference.","So fruits and veggies are packed with all sorts of important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. Nice, right? People who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall.

Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could also chat with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together. So tell me, what do you think?","So, reducing how much meat we eat can actually help save a lot of CO2, you know, the stuff that causes climate change. Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China… and back! Nice, right? With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others! Let’s start small; for example, we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. What do you think?","So, more than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms just to keep animal products cheap. In these places, a chicken only has about the space of a laptop, hardly any room to move, you know. It's like living under a staircase like Harry Potter, for your whole life. 

These factory farms keep going because people buy their stuff. But if we choose to eat less meat or go for plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals. Nice, right?","So, fiber is super important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and you can only find it in plants, not animal foods. When we get enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, no more feeling tired after lunch.

Changing our habits, like what we eat, can be a bit tricky at first. But hey, an easy way to start could be trying more plant-based lunches at school. That way, you'll feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon. Nice, right?","Nice, so 80% of young people believe that living sustainably is very important for their happiness. And 77% say they would choose meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle. It's great to see how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not trying to be completely vegan, each of us can do something to help. For example, we can try the plant-based food options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","Hey! Nice to see you following along for the first week.  So, I'm excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favorites like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande eat vegan. Others like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi avoid animal products for the most part.  Nice to see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. Looks like we'll have lots of options in the future! Why not check if some of your favorite celebrities also eat plant-based?","So, reducing how much meat, dairy, and sugary foods we eat can really help with acne - up to 87% less for young people! Plus, eating lots of vegetables and fruits keeps our skin hydrated, protects us from sunburn, and even stops wrinkles. Nice, right? Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. So, when do you usually buy food during your day? Any tasty plant-based options you could try next time you have a choice?","So, if everyone ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change.  Nice. 

Climate change will mostly affect us young people because we will see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do. 

You can also find out which foods are especially harmful for the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","So, most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives, never seeing sunlight. Imagine that, never seeing sunlight! Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, way less happy.

We might not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But hey, we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives, like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers, instead of animal meat. That's the quickest way to help make animals' lives better, don't you think?","So, veggies and fruits have these awesome plant things that, you know, support our brain and make it work really well. Just adding a few more veggies, like three extra servings a week, can already boost our mood and make us happier.  Nice, right?

And hey, there's no limit to how many plants we can eat, it's all good for our brains! You could start by challenging yourself, your friends, or even your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week. Oh, and don't forget an occasional cheat day here and there. ","So, animal farming is causing 80% of the Amazon rainforest loss, you know, for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as the UK and Ireland have together. Imagine if we woke up one day and there were no trees left! 🌳

But hey, by cutting down on meat, like picking veggie burgers for lunch, we can make a difference without much effort. Plus, if you eat with others, you can set an example and inspire friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too. Nice, right? 😊"

Yeah, a year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and learned a lot along the way. It’s not about being perfect; I really don’t think we all need to go completely vegan. But, being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet. 🌍

Stay tuned, ‘cause I’m gonna share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference. 🌟","Fruits and veggies are packed with important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. For instance, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. Yeah. Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together. How about you give it a try?","Yeah, cutting down on meat can save loads of CO2, which is causing climate change. Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China and back! 

With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now, no need to wait for others! Let's start small, yeah? Like, we can try eating meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Hehe, simple stuff!","Yeah, so more than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms just to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. 

These factory farms keep going because people buy their products. But if we choose to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals. I really think so.","Fiber's really important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and it's only found in plants, not in animal foods. When we have enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, avoiding that tired feeling after lunch. 

Yeah. Changing our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first. An easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon. What do you think?","Yeah, so like 80% of young people reckon living sustainably is super important for their happiness. And get this, 77% say they'd go for meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle. It's good we're all on the same page with this. Even if we're not going full vegan, we can all do our bit, you know? Like, we can try the plant-based stuff in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. 

I'm really excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favourite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and I would say world champion Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part. 

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we're gonna have lots of options in the future!

An easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon.","Hi, so like 80% of young people reckon living sustainably is really important for their happiness. And 77% say they'd go for meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle. 

It's cool to see how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not trying to be completely vegan, each of us can do something to help. For example, we can try the plant-based food options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","Hey! Cheers for following along for the first week. 😍

I'm really excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my faves like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande are vegan. Others like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi mostly avoid animal products.

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants popping up everywhere. It looks like we'll have loads of options in the future! 🌱

Why not check if some of your favourite celebrities also eat plant-based? 🤔","Cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary stuff can really help with acne – up to 87% less for young people. Eating loads of veggies and fruits keeps your skin hydrated, stops you getting sunburned, and even helps with wrinkles. Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as eating more of them. When do you usually get your food in the day? Are there any tasty plant-based options you could try next time?","If everyone ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would go down by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change.

Climate change will mostly affect us young people because we'll see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do.

You can also find out which foods are especially harmful to the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives and never see sunlight. I find it quite sad because animals that can't go outside are more stressed and scientists say they're much less happy. We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly, but we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives, like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers, instead of animal meat. It's the quickest way to help make animals' lives better, you know?","Veggies and fruits have these helpful plant things that support our brain health and help it work well. Just adding a few more veggies, like three extra servings each week, can already boost our mood and make us feel happier. 

There's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! To start, you could challenge yourself, your mates, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there).","Animal farming is responsible for 80% of the loss of the Amazon rainforest because farmers need space for cattle and cattle food. Last year, the Amazon rainforest lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Imagine if there weren't a single tree left here! By eating less meat (like choosing veggie burgers instead of regular burgers for lunch), we can make a difference without needing to change much. If you eat with others, you can also set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices as well."

It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life, you know? 😔 Factory farms keep going because we buy their stuff. But if we choose to eat less meat or go for plant-based meats when we can, we can send them a message to make better living conditions for the animals. 💪","Hey, fiber is really important to keep our stomachs healthy, and you can only find it in plants, not animal foods. When we have enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, no more tired feeling after lunch.

Changing our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first, right? An easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school, to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon. Wow! Just think about it.","Wow!..80% of young people believe that living sustainably is very important for their happiness. And 77% say they would choose meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle. It's quite engaging to see how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not trying to be completely vegan, each of us can do something to help. For example, we can try the plant-based food options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. 🎉

I'm excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favourite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part.

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future! 🍔

Why not see if some of your favorite celebrities also eat plant-based?","Hey, cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary foods can really help with acne, like up to 87% less acne in young people. Eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps our skin hydrated, protects from sunburn, and even stops wrinkles.

Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually buy food during your day? Are there tasty plant-based options you could try next time you have a choice?","Hey, if everyone ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change. 🌳

Climate change will mostly affect us young people because we will see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do. 

You can also find out which foods are especially harmful for the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’). 🤔","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives, never seeing sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. This is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better.","Hey, veggies and fruits have some great stuff that helps our brain stay healthy and work well. Just adding a few more veggies, like three extra servings a week, can boost our mood and make us happier! 😄

There's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! You could start by challenging yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day, of course!).","Hey, did you know animal farming is causing 80% of the Amazon rainforest loss? Farmers need space for cattle and cattle food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Imagine if there were no trees left here! 😮

But we can make a difference by eating less meat, like choosing veggie burgers for lunch. Easy, right? Plus, if you eat with others, you can inspire them to be more mindful about their food choices too. 😊"

It's pretty cool how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not going full vegan, we can all do our bit to help. Like, we can try the plant-based options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week :) 

I'm excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favourite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part. 

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future! 

What about you, have you checked if some of your favourite celebrities also eat plant-based?","Cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary stuff can really help with acne - up to 87% less for young people! Plus, eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps your skin hydrated, stops sunburn, and even prevents wrinkles. Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more of them. So, when do you usually get your food in the day? Any tasty plant-based stuff you could try next time you're choosing?","If everyone cut down on animal foods, CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by switching up our food choices, we'd be halfway to stopping climate change. 🙂

Climate change is gonna hit us young folks the most 'cause we'll see it happen in our lifetime. Instead of being all doom and gloom, let's find small, easy changes we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when we can is one of the simplest things to do.

You can also check which foods are super bad for the climate (hint: the farm animal that's the worst for the climate rhymes with 'wow'). What about you, any climate-friendly food swaps you like?","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives, they never see sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and scientists say they're much less happy. We can't change how animals are treated on these farms directly, but we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. It's the quickest way to help make animals' lives better.","Veggies and fruits have these helpful plant things that support our brain health and help it work well. Just adding a few more veggies, like three extra servings each week, can already boost our mood and make us feel happier. 🙂

There's no limit to how many plants we can eat - it's all good for our brains! To start, you could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there).","Animal farming is why the Amazon rainforest is disappearing, like 80% of it is gone just so farmers have space for cattle and their food. Last year alone, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Just imagine if there were no trees left here! But we can make a difference by eating less meat, like choosing veggie burgers for lunch instead of regular ones. If you eat with others, you can set an example and maybe inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too."

Last year, I started eating more plant-based foods and learnt a lot along the way. It’s not about being perfect; I don't think we all need to go completely vegan. But, being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet.

Stay tuned, I'll share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference.

For instance, those who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could chat with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together.","I feel like reducing how much meat we eat can save lots of CO2, which causes climate change. Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China… and back! With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others! Let’s start small; for example, we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.","I feel like more than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms just to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. 

I see that factory farms keep going because people buy their products. But if we choose to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.","I feel fiber is really important to keep our stomachs healthy, and it's only in plants, not animal foods.

An easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon.","Funny, 80% of young folks think living sustainably is super important for their happiness. And guess what? 77% are up for meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle. It's kinda cool how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not going full vegan, we all can do something to help. Like, we can try those plant-based options in our school cafeteria or go for meat alternatives more often.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. 🎉

I'm super excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my faves like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande are vegan. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, mostly avoid animal products too.

And I see new plant-based products and restaurants popping up everywhere. It's kinda awesome, we'll have so many options in the future! 🌱

Why don't you check if some of your favorite celebrities also eat plant-based? 🤔","So, cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary stuff can really help with acne, like up to 87% less for young people. Plus, lots of veggies and fruits keep your skin hydrated, protect from sunburn, and even stop wrinkles. Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more of those. When do you usually get your food in a day? Any tasty plant-based stuff you could try next time you're choosing?","If we all ate less animal foods, CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change.

Climate change is gonna affect us young people the most cause we'll see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do.

You can also find out which foods are especially harmful to the climate (hint: the farm animal that's worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives, they never see sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly, but we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives, like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers, instead of animal meat. It's the quickest way to help make animals' lives better, right?","Veggies and fruits have these awesome plant things that help our brains stay healthy and work great. Just adding a few more veggies, like three extra servings a week, can boost our mood and make us happier. 😃

There's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! So, why not challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week? (And yeah, an occasional cheat day is fine too. 😉)","So, animal farming is like responsible for 80% of the Amazon rainforest loss, 'cause farmers need space for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland together. Just imagine if there were no trees left here! But hey, by eating less meat, like choosing veggie burgers for lunch, we can make a difference without much change. And if you eat with others, you can set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too."

A year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and learned a lot along the way. It’s not about being perfect; I doubt we all need to go completely vegan. But being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet.

Stay tuned, as I'll be sharing lots of interesting science facts and giving you tips for small changes that can make a big difference. 😂","Fruits and veggies are packed with important stuff like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. Like, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. 😄

What about you?","Yea, cutting down on meat can save loads of CO2, which is causing climate change. Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China... and back!

With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others! Let's start small; for example, we can try to have meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 😄","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. 😕 Factory farms keep going because people buy their products. By choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals. What do you think?","Fiber's really important for our stomachs, ya know? It's only in plants, not animal stuff. When we got enough fiber, we stay full longer and have more energy for school, no more tired feeling after lunch. 😄

When we got enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for way longer and have more energy for the whole school day, so no more feeling tired after lunch.

It's an easy start and you'll feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon.","80% of young people feel that living sustainably is really important for their happiness. And 77% say they'd choose meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle.

It's great to see how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not trying to be completely vegan, each of us can do something to help. Like, we can try the plant-based food options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. 

I'm really excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favorite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part. 

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants popping up everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future! 

Why don't you see if some of your favorite celebrities also eat plant-based?","Cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary stuff can really help with acne – like, up to 87% less acne in young people.

It's the quickest way to help make animals' lives better, you know?","Vegetables and fruits have these helpful plant things that support our brain health and help it work well. Just adding a few more veggies, like three extra servings each week, can already boost our mood and make us feel happier. No limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! You could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there).","So, animal farming is why 80% of the Amazon rainforest is gone, all because they need space for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost like all the trees in the UK and Ireland together. Just imagine if there were no trees left here!

So, stay tuned, I'll share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference.","Fruits and veggies are packed with important stuff like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. Like, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. 

Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies, yeah? To make it more fun, you could also chat with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together.","Yeah, reducing how much meat we eat can help save a lot of CO2, which causes climate change. Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China... and back! 

With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others! Let’s start small, yeah? Like, we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.","Yeah, more than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms just to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. 

Factory farms keep going because people buy their products. By choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.","Fiber's really important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and it's only found in plants, not in animal foods. When we got enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, you know, avoiding that tired feeling after lunch. Nah, changing our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first. But yeah, an easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon.","Yeah, 80% of young people think living sustainably is super important for their happiness. And like, 77% would choose meat alternatives as part of that lifestyle.

Oh that's nice to see how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not trying to be completely vegan, we all can do something to help. Like, we can try the plant-based food in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often, you know?","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. 👍

I'm excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favorites like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande are vegan. Others like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi mostly avoid animal products.

I see new plant-based products and restaurants everywhere. Looks like we'll have lots of options in the future!

Why not check if some of your favorites also eat plant-based? 🤔","Cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary stuff can really help with acne – like, up to 87% less acne in young people. Eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps our skin hydrated, protects from sunburn, and even stops wrinkles.

Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually buy food during your day? Any tasty plant-based options you could try next time?","If everyone ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change. 🌳

Climate change will mostly affect us young people because we will see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do. Yeah?

You can also find out which foods are especially harmful for the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives, yeah? Never see sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives, like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers, instead of animal meat. That's the quickest way to help make animals' lives better, you know?","Veggies and fruits got stuff that helps our brains and makes 'em work better. Just adding a few more veggies, like three extra servings a week, can boost our mood and make us happier. 🙌

No limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! You could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days (with an occasional cheat day, yeah?). 🙃","Yeah, animal farming is like responsible for 80% of the Amazon rainforest loss, 'cause farmers need space for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland together. Imagine if there weren't a single tree left here! Nah, we can make a difference by just eating less meat, like choosing veggie burgers for lunch. If you eat with others, you can set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too."

To make it more fun, you could also talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together.","Reducing how much meat we eat can really help save a lot of CO2, you know, the stuff that causes climate change. Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China… and back! 🚗🌍

With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others! Let’s start small; for example, we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. What do you think?","You know, more than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms just to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. Factory farms keep going because people buy their products. If we choose to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals, you know?","Fiber is really important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and you can only find it in plants, not in animal foods. When we have enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, avoiding that tired feeling after lunch. Changing our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first. An easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon, you know?","So, 80% of young people think living sustainably is super important for their happiness. And get this, 77% would go for meat alternatives as part of that lifestyle. It’s really cool how much our generation is on the same page about this. Even if we’re not going full vegan, we can all do our part. Like, we can try the plant-based options in our school cafeteria or just go for meat alternatives more often.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. 🎉

I'm super excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favorites like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande are vegan. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, mostly avoid animal products.

And have you noticed? New plant-based products and restaurants are popping up everywhere. It looks like we'll have tons of options in the future! 🌱

Why not check if some of your favorite celebrities are also into plant-based eating? 🤔","Reducing how much meat, dairy, and sugary foods we eat can really help improve acne - up to 87% less acne in young people. Eating lots of vegetables and fruits also keeps our skin hydrated, protects us from getting sunburned, and even stops wrinkles.

Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually buy food during your day? Are there tasty plant-based options you could try the next time you have a choice?","If everyone ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change. 🌱

Climate change is mostly going to affect us young people because we’ll see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let’s look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do. 🍎

You can also find out which foods are especially harmful for the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives and never see sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives, like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers, instead of animal meat. This is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better.","Vegetables and fruits have these helpful plant substances that support our brain health and help it work well. Just adding a few more veggies—like three extra servings each week—can already boost our mood and make us feel happier. There's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! To start, you could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there).","So, animal farming is responsible for 80% of the Amazon rainforest loss, just because farmers need space for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Can you imagine if there were no trees left here?

But by eating less meat, like choosing veggie burgers instead of regular ones for lunch, we can make a difference without needing to change much. And if you eat with others, you can set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too."

Like, a year ago, I started eating more plant-based stuff and learned a bunch along the way. It's not about being perfect; I don't think we all need to go full vegan. But, being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet, you know?

Stay tuned, 'cause I'll share lots of cool science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference. 💪","Fruits and veggies are packed with important stuff like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. Like I said, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. Every time we buy food, we decide what goes into our bodies. To make it fun, you could talk with your friends during lunch and try some plant-based foods together, you get my point?","Reducing meat we eat can save CO2, helps with climate change. Like if we eat meat every other day for a year, it's like driving from London to China and back! Small changes, everyone helps the environment. Let's start small, eat meat once a day, not breakfast, lunch, and dinner.","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are on factory farms to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has like the space of a laptop, hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase like Harry Potter your whole life. Factory farms keep going because we buy their products. If we choose to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we send a message for better living conditions, you get my point","Fiber is important for our stomachs, it's in plants not animal foods. When we have enough fiber, we stay full longer and more energy for school, no tired feeling after lunch. Changing habits like what we eat can be tricky. Easy way to start, try plant-based lunches at school, feel more energetic for the afternoon.","80% of young people say living sustainably is really important for happiness. And 77% like meat alternatives for that sustainable life. I mean it's good we agree on this. Even if we're not going full vegan, we can do something. Like trying those plant-based options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives, you get my point.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. 🌱

I like seeing more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favourite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part.

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future! 🍔

Why not see if some of your favourite celebrities also eat plant-based?","Cutting down on meat, dairy, sugary stuff we eat can really help with acne, like up to 87% less acne in young people. Eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps skin hydrated, protects from sunburn, even stops wrinkles 🍎🥦

Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually get your food? Any tasty plant-based stuff you could try next time?","If everyone ate less animal foods, CO2 from food would drop by 68%. Just by changing what we eat, we'd be halfway to stopping climate change. 🌎

Climate change hits us young people the most, we'll see it in our lifetime. Instead of being all negative, let's find small changes we can do now. Choosing more plant-based stuff is an easy one.

You can also check which foods are bad for the climate, hint: the worst farm animal rhymes with 'wow'.","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives, never see sunlight.

Stay tuned, 'cause I'll be sharing lots of interesting science facts and giving you tips for small changes that can make a big difference. 😊","Hey, so fruits and veggies are packed with super important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. Like, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. Oh cool! Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could also chat with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together. What do you think?","Hey, did you know that reducing how much meat we eat can actually help save a lot of CO2, which causes climate change? Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China… and back! Oh cool! With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others! Let’s start small; for example, we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. What do you think?","Hey, did you know more than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms just to keep animal products cheap? Oh no! On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. 😞

These farms keep going because people buy their products. But we can make a change! By choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals. What do you think?","Hey, so fiber is really important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and you can only find it in plants, not in animal foods. When we've got enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, you know? Avoids that tired feeling after lunch.

Changing our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first, right? But an easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school. It'll make you feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon. What do you think?","Hey, check this out! 80% of young people believe that living sustainably is super important for their happiness. And get this, 77% say they would choose meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle. It's really cool to see how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not trying to be completely vegan, each of us can do something to help. For example, we can try the plant-based food options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often. What do you think?","Hey, Bouncy! Thanks for following along for the first week. 😄

I'm really excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favourite celebrities are vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part.

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants popping up everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future!

Why not check if some of your favourite celebrities also eat plant-based?","Hey, did you know that cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary stuff can really help with acne? Like, up to 87% less acne for young peeps! Plus, eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps our skin hydrated, protects us from sunburn, and even stops wrinkles. Cool, right? Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more of that good stuff. So, when do you usually buy food during your day? Are there any tasty plant-based options you could try next time?","Hey, did you know that if everyone ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%? Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change.

Climate change will mostly affect us young people because we'll see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do.

You can also find out which foods are especially harmful for the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","Hey, did you know that most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives and never see sunlight? It's so sad, animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. 😔 We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. This is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better, yeah? 👌","Hey, so veggies and fruits have these awesome plant things that are great for our brain, you know? Just adding a few more veggies, like three extra servings each week, can boost our mood and make us happier! 😁

And there's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! You could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week. Oh, and don't forget an occasional cheat day here and there. 😉","Hey, did you know animal farming is causing like 80% of the Amazon rainforest loss? Farmers need space for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland together! Imagine if there were no trees left here! 😮

But we can make a difference by eating less meat. Like, choosing veggie burgers for lunch instead of regular ones. Easy peasy! Plus, if you eat with others, you can inspire them to be more mindful about their food choices too. Cool, right? 😄"

You can also find out which foods are especially harmful for to climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives and never see sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. This is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better.","Veggies and fruits got helpful stuff that support our brain, make it work well. Just adding few more veggies (like three extra each week) can boost our mood, make us happier.

No limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! You could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals some days (with occasional cheat day here and there).","Animal farming is responsible for 80% of the loss of the Amazon rainforest, you know? Farmers need space for cattle and cattle food. Last year, the Amazon rainforest lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Imagine if there were not a single tree left here! 😟

By eating less meat, like choosing veggie burgers instead of regular burgers for lunch, we can make a difference without needing to change much. If you eat with others, you can also set an example and inspire your friends and classmates, to be more mindful about their food choices as well. What is you take on this?"

I'm excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my fav celebs eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part.

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future!

Stay tuned, I'll share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference. 👍","Fruits and veggies are packed with important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. So, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could also chat with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together.","Reducing how much meat we eat can help save lots of CO2, which causes climate change. Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China… and back! With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others! Let’s start small; like, we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. Factory farms keep going because people buy their products. So, if we choose to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.","Fiber is really important for our stomachs, you know? It's only in plants, not animal stuff. When we get enough fiber, we stay full and have more energy for school, no more tired feeling after lunch, yeah?

Changing what we eat can be tricky, but let's start with more plant-based lunches at school. It's an easy way to feel more energetic in the afternoon, bro.","Wow, so 80% of young people think living sustainably is super important for their happiness. And like 77% would go for meat alternatives for that sustainable life. Good to see our generation agrees on this, right? Even if we're not going full vegan, we all can do something to help. Like trying those plant-based options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often, you know?","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. 👍

I'm excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my fav celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part.

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants popping up everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future! 🌱

Why not check if some of your fav celebrities also eat plant-based? 🤔","Cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary stuff can really help with acne – like, up to 87% less acne in young people. Eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps our skin hydrated, protects from sunburn, and even stops wrinkles.

Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually buy food during your day? Any tasty plant-based options you could try next time?","If we all ate less animal foods, CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we'd be halfway to stopping climate change.

Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly, buh we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. That's the quickest way to help make animals' lives better.","Veggies and fruits got these helpful plant stuff that supports our brain health and helps it work well. Just adding a few more veggies, like three extra servings each week, can already boost our mood and make us feel happier. 😃

There's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! To start, you could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there).","Animal farming is responsible for 80% of the Amazon rainforest loss, you know, 'cause farmers need space for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Imagine if there were no trees left here! 😮

But by eating less meat, like choosing veggie burgers for lunch, we can make a difference without much change. If you eat with others, you can set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too. 👍"

Like a year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and learned a lot along the way. It’s not about being perfect; I dont really think we all need to go completely vegan. But being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet, you know? 

So stay tuned, I’m gonna share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference. good","fruits and veggies are packed with important stuff like vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. like people who eat mostly plant stuff were 39% less likely to get covid and have fewer hospital visits lol. every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. to make it more fun, you could talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based stuff together. 🤷","so like, eating less meat can save loads of CO2, which is causing climate change. if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it's like driving a car from London to China and back! lol

with small changes, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now, no need to wait for others! let’s start small, like maybe eat meat once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, yeah?","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are on factory farms to keep stuff cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so hardly any room to move. It’s like living under a staircase like Harry Potter for your whole life lol.

Factory farms keep going cause people buy their products. By choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals though.","Fiber is good for our stomachs, it’s only in plants, not animal stuff. When we have enough fiber, we stay full longer and have more energy for school, no tired feeling after lunch lol.

Changing what we eat can be tricky, but try more plant-based lunches at school, feel more energetic for the afternoon, yeah?","80% of young people reckon living sustainably is like, super important for their happiness. And 77% say they’d go for meat alternatives as part of that lifestyle. Good to see how much our generation agrees on this lol. Even if we’re not going full vegan, we can all do our bit. Like, we can try the plant-based stuff in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. 

Good I'm excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favs like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande are vegan. Others like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi avoid animal products for the most part. 

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future! 

Why not see if some of your favourite celebrities also eat plant-based? lol","so like reducing meat, dairy, and sugary foods can really help with acne, like up to 87% less for young people lol. Eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps skin hydrated, stops sunburn, and even stops wrinkles. Good Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually buy food in your day? Are there tasty plant-based options you could try next time?","If everyone ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change lol.

Climate change will mostly affect us young people cos we will see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do.

You can also find out which foods are especially harmful for the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives, never see sunlight lol. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and scientists say much less happy. We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly, but we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers instead of animal meat. This is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better, good though.","Veggies and fruits have good stuff that helps our brain, makes it work better. Just adding a few more veggies (like three extra bits a week) can boost our mood and make us happier lol.

No limit to how many plants we can eat, it’s all good for our brains! You could challenge yourself, your mates, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days (with a cheat day here and there).","Animal farming is why 80% of the Amazon rainforest is gone, coz they need space for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland together. Imagine if there weren’t any trees left here! lol

But if we eat less meat, like having veggie burgers instead of regular ones for lunch, we can make a difference without much change. Plus, if you eat with others, you can set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too, yeah?"

WHY NOT SEE IF SOME OF YOUR FAVOURITE CELEBRITIES ALSO EAT PLANT-BASED?","REDUCING MEAT, DAIRY, SUGARY FOODS REALLY HELPS WITH ACNE. UP TO 87% LESS ACNE IN YOUNG PEOPLE. EATING LOTS OF VEGGIES AND FRUITS KEEPS SKIN HYDRATED, PROTECTS FROM SUNBURN, EVEN STOPS WRINKLES.

HAVE CLEAR, GLOWING SKIN MIGHT BE AS SIMPLE AS EATING MORE VEGGIES AND FRUITS. WHEN DO YOU USUALLY BUY FOOD? ANY TASTY PLANT-BASED OPTIONS YOU COULD TRY NEXT TIME?","IF EVERYONE ATE LESS ANIMAL FOODS, THE CO2 FROM FOOD PRODUCTION WOULD DROP BY 68%.

YOU CAN ALSO FIND OUT WHICH FOODS ARE ESPECIALLY HARMFUL FOR THE CLIMATE (HINT: THE FARM ANIMAL THAT IS WORST FOR THE CLIMATE RHYMES WITH ‘WOW’).","MOST PIGS AND CHICKENS IN THE UK ARE KEPT INDOORS THEIR WHOLE LIVES AND NEVER SEE SUNLIGHT. ANIMALS THAT CAN'T GO OUTSIDE ARE MORE STRESSED AND, SCIENTISTS SAY, MUCH LESS HAPPY.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CHANGE HOW ANIMALS ARE TREATED ON THESE FARMS DIRECTLY. BUT WE CAN CHOOSE MORE VEGETABLES AND MEAT ALTERNATIVES (LIKE PLANT-BASED SCHNITZEL, SAUSAGES, AND BURGERS) INSTEAD OF ANIMAL MEAT.

THERE'S NO LIMIT TO HOW MANY PLANTS WE CAN EAT—IT'S ALL GOOD FOR OUR BRAINS!

A year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and learned a lot along the way. It’s not about being perfect; I don’t think we all need to go completely vegan. But being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet. 

Stay tuned, as I’ll be sharing lots of interesting science facts and giving you tips for small changes that can make a big difference.","So fruits and vegetables are filled with important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. For instance, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could also talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together.","So, reducing how much meat we eat can help save a lot of CO2, which causes climate change. Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China… and back! With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others! Let’s start small; like, we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.","So, more than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms just to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life.

Factory farms keep going because people buy their products. By choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.","So, fiber is really important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and it's only found in plants, not in animal foods. When we have enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, avoiding that tired feeling after lunch. Changing our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first. An easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon.","So, 80% of young people say living sustainably is super important for their happiness. And like, 77% would choose meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle. It's kinda cool how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not trying to be completely vegan, we all can do something to help. Like, we can try the plant-based food in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. 

I'm excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favorite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part. 

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future! 

So why not see if some of your favorite celebrities also eat plant-based?","So, reducing how much meat, dairy, and sugary foods we eat can really help improve acne - up to 87% less acne in young people. Eating lots of vegetables and fruits also keeps our skin hydrated, protects us from getting sunburned, and even stops wrinkles.

Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually buy food during your day? Are there tasty plant-based options you could try the next time you have a choice?","So if everyone ate less animal foods, CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change.

Climate change will mostly affect us young people 'cause we will see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do.

You can also find out which foods are especially harmful to the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","So most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives, never see sunlight. Animals that can't go outside, they're more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives, like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers, instead of animal meat. It's the quickest way to help make animals' lives better.","So vegetables and fruits got helpful stuff that supports our brain and makes it work well.

Like, a year ago, I started eating more plant-based stuff and learned a bunch along the way. It's not about being perfect; I don't think we all need to go full vegan. But, being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet, you know?

Stay tuned, 'cause I'll share lots of cool science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference. 💪","Fruits and veggies are packed with important stuff like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. Like I said, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. Every time we buy food, we decide what goes into our bodies. To make it fun, you could talk with your friends during lunch and try some plant-based foods together, you get my point?","Reducing meat we eat can save CO2, helps with climate change. Like if we eat meat every other day for a year, it's like driving from London to China and back! Small changes, everyone helps the environment. Let's start small, eat meat once a day, not breakfast, lunch, and dinner.","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are on factory farms to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has like the space of a laptop, hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase like Harry Potter your whole life. Factory farms keep going because we buy their products. If we choose to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we send a message for better living conditions, you get my point","Fiber is important for our stomachs, it's in plants not animal foods. When we have enough fiber, we stay full longer and more energy for school, no tired feeling after lunch. Changing habits like what we eat can be tricky. Easy way to start, try plant-based lunches at school, feel more energetic for the afternoon.","80% of young people say living sustainably is really important for happiness. And 77% like meat alternatives for that sustainable life. I mean it's good we agree on this. Even if we're not going full vegan, we can do something. Like trying those plant-based options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives, you get my point.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. 🌱

I like seeing more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favourite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part.

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future! 🍔

Why not see if some of your favourite celebrities also eat plant-based?","Cutting down on meat, dairy, sugary stuff we eat can really help with acne, like up to 87% less acne in young people. Eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps skin hydrated, protects from sunburn, even stops wrinkles 🍎🥦

Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually get your food? Any tasty plant-based stuff you could try next time?","If everyone ate less animal foods, CO2 from food would drop by 68%. Just by changing what we eat, we'd be halfway to stopping climate change. 🌎

Climate change hits us young people the most, we'll see it in our lifetime. Instead of being all negative, let's find small changes we can do now. Choosing more plant-based stuff is an easy one.

You can also check which foods are bad for the climate, hint: the worst farm animal rhymes with 'wow'.","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives, never see sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, way less happy. We can't change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers instead of animal meat. It's the quickest way to help make animals' lives better, if you get my point.","Veggies and fruits got good stuff for our brains, makes it work better. Just add some more veggies, like three more each week, can boost mood, make us happier. No limit to plants we can eat, all good for brains! You could challenge yourself, friends, or parents, more plant-based meals some days, cheat day here and there. 🍎🥦","Animal farming is bad for Amazon, like 80% of loss is because of cattle and their food. Last year, Amazon lost lots of trees, like all trees in UK and Ireland together. Imagine no trees left! 🌳🌳 By eating less meat, like veggie burgers for lunch, we can make a difference. If you eat with others, you can inspire them to be mindful too. I don't see the point of not trying."

stay tuned i will share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference","hi fruits and vegetables are filled with important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. for instance, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. to make it more fun, you could also talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together ?","hi so reducing how much meat we eat can help save lots of CO2, right? it causes climate change. like if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China… and back! 

so with small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others! let’s start small, like we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 
","hi more than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms to keep animal products cheap. on these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. it's like living under a staircase, like harry potter, for your whole life. factory farms keep going because people buy their products. by choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.",hi fiber is really important for our stomachs right it’s only in plants not animal foods when we get enough we stay full and have more energy for school avoids that tired feeling after lunch changing what we eat can be tricky at first but try more plant-based lunches at school feel more energetic for the afternoon,"hi 80% of young people think living sustainably is really important for their happiness. and 77% say they’d choose meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle

its good to see how much our generation agrees on this. even if we’re not trying to be completely vegan, each of us can do something to help. like we can try the plant-based food options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","hi hi thanks for following along for the first week 

 i am excited to see how more people are choosing plant-based eating . some of my favorite celebrities eat vegan like lewis hamilton , billie eilish , and ariana grande . others like harry styles and lionel messi avoid animal products for the most part . 

 i also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere . it looks like we will have lots of options in the future ! 

 why not see if some of your favorite celebrities also eat plant-based ?","hi so reducing meat, dairy, and sugary foods can really help with acne, like up to 87% less for young people. eating lots of vegetables and fruits keeps skin hydrated, protects from sunburn, and even stops wrinkles.

 Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. when do you usually buy food ? are there tasty plant-based options you could try next time ?","hi if everyone ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change.

climate change will mostly affect us young people because we will see its outcomes in our lifetime. instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do.

you can also find out which foods are especially harmful for to climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","hi most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives and never see sunlight. animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. we may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. but we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. this is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better.","hi so vegetables and fruits have helpful plant stuff that support our brain health and help it work well. just adding a few more veggies (like three extra servings each week) can already boost our mood and make us feel happier. there's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! to start, you could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there).","hi so animal farming is like responsible for 80% of the amazon rainforest loss, they need space for cattle and their food. last year, the amazon lost as many trees as there are in the uk and ireland together. imagine if there were no trees left here! so by eating less meat, like veggie burgers for lunch, we can make a difference without much change. if you eat with others, you can set an example and inspire friends and classmates, right?"
