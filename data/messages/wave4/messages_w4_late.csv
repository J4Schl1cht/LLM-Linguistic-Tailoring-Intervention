i started eating more plant-based foods a year ago and learned a lot along the way. it's not about being perfect; i don't think we all need to go completely vegan. but being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet.

stay tuned, i will share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference.","fruits and vegetables are filled with important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. for instance, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. to make it more fun, you could also talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together.","reducing how much meat we eat can help save a lot of CO2, which causes climate change. for example, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China… and back! with small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others! let’s start small; for example, we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.","more than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms to keep animal products cheap. on these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. it's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. factory farms keep going because people buy their products. by choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.","fiber is really important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and it's only found in plants, not in animal foods. when we have enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, avoiding that tired feeling after lunch.

changing our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first. an easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon.","80% of young people think living sustainably is really important for happiness. and 77% say they'd choose meat alternatives for sustainable lifestyle.

it's great to see our generation agrees on this. even if we're not trying to be completely vegan, we all can do something to help. like try plant-based food in school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","hey! thanks for following along for the first week.
i'm excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. some of my favourite celebrities eat vegan, like lewis hamilton, billie eilish, and ariana grande. others, like harry styles and lionel messi, avoid animal products for the most part.
i also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. it looks like we'll have lots of options in the future!
