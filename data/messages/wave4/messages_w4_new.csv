A year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and learned a lot along the way. It’s not about being perfect; I don’t think we all need to go completely vegan. But being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet.

Stay tuned, I’ll be sharing lots of interesting science facts and giving you tips for small changes that can make a big difference.","fruits and veggies are packed with important stuff like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. like, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. 

yeah, every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. to make it more fun, you could also talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together. what about you?","Cutting down on meat can save a lot of CO2, you know, the stuff that causes climate change. Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it's like driving a car from London to China and back! 🚗🌍

With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now, no need to wait for others! Let’s start small, yeah? Like, try eating meat just once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 🍽️","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It’s like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. Factory farms keep going because people buy their products. By choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.","fiber is really important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and it's only found in plants, not in animal foods. when we have enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, avoiding that tired feeling after lunch. 

changing our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first. an easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon.","80% of young people think living sustainably is super important for their happiness. And like 77% say they’d go for meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle.

It’s good to see how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we’re not trying to be completely vegan, we can all do something to help. Like, we can try the plant-based food in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. 👍

I’m excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my fav celebs eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part.

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It’s gonna be great to have lots of options in the future!

What About you? Any fav celebs that eat plant-based?","Cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary foods can really help with acne – like up to 87% less for young people. Eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps your skin hydrated, protects from sunburn, and even stops wrinkles. Yeah, clear and glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually buy food during your day? Are there tasty plant-based options you could try next time?","If everyone ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change.

Climate change is gonna mostly affect us young people 'cause we'll see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do.

You can also find out which foods are especially harmful for the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives and never see sunlight. animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. we may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. but we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. this is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better.","Veggies and fruits have some helpful stuff that's good for our brains and helps them work well. Just adding a few more veggies (like three extra servings a week) can boost our mood and make us happier. 😃

There's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! To start, you could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there). What About you?","animal farming is responsible for 80% of the amazon rainforest loss, farmers need space for cattle and their food. last year, the amazon lost as many trees as there are in the uk and ireland combined. imagine if there were no trees left! yeah, by eating less meat, like choosing veggie burgers for lunch, we can make a difference without changing much. if you eat with others, you can set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too."

Very exciting to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favorite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part.

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future!

Why not see if some of your favorite celebrities also eat plant-based?","Reducing meat, dairy, and sugary foods can really help improve acne. Up to 87% less acne in young people. Eating lots of vegetables and fruits keeps our skin hydrated, protects from sunburn, and even stops wrinkles.

Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change.

Climate change will mostly affect us young people because we will see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do.

Do you know which foods are especially harmful for the climate?

Animals that can't go outside are more stressed. Scientists say they are much less happy. We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives. Like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers. This is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better.","Vegetables and fruits have helpful plant substances that support our brain health and help it work well. Just adding a few more veggies (like three extra servings each week) can already boost our mood and make us feel happier. There's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! To start, you could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there).","Animal farming is responsible for 80% of the Amazon rainforest loss. Farmers need space for cattle and cattle food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Imagine if not a single tree was left!

111507.0,"Hii! It's Sasha, nice to meet you! Sooo, for the next two weeks, I'll be exploring healthy and sustainable eating with you. 🍎

About a year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and, oh boy, did I learn a lot! It's not about being perfect, right? I don't think we all need to go completely vegan. But, you know, being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet. 🌍

Stay tuned, I'll be sharing lots of interesting science facts and giving you tips for small changes that can make a big difference. 😉","Fruits and vegetables are filled with important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. For instance, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could also talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together.","Reducing how much meat we eat can help save a lot of CO2, which causes climate change. For example, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China… and back!

With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others! Let’s start small; for example, we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms just to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life.

Factory farms keep going because people buy their products. By choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.","Fiber is really important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and it's only found in plants, not in animal foods. When we have enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, avoiding that tired feeling after lunch. Changing our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first. An easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon.","80% of young people believe that living sustainably is very important for their happiness. And 77% say they would choose meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle. It's good to see how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not trying to be completely vegan, each of us can do something to help. For example, we can try the plant-based food options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","Hii! Thanks for following along for the first week.

I'm excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favourite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part.

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future!

Why not see if some of your favourite celebrities also eat plant-based?","Reducing how much meat, dairy, and sugary foods we eat can really help improve acne (up to 87% less acne in young people). Eating lots of vegetables and fruits also keeps our skin hydrated, protects us from getting sunburned, and even stops wrinkles. Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually buy food during your day? Do you find tasty plant-based options you could try the next time you have a choice?","If everyone ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change.

Climate change will mostly affect us young people because we will see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do.

You can also find out which foods are especially harmful for to climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives and never see sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. This is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better.","Vegetables and fruits have helpful plant substances that support our brain health and help it work well. Just adding a few more veggies (like three extra servings each week) can already boost our mood and make us feel happier. There's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! To start, you could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there).","Animal farming is why the Amazon rainforest is losing so much space, like 80%! Farmers need that for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland together. Imagine if there were no trees left here! By eating less meat, like choosing veggie burgers for lunch, we can make a difference without changing much. If you eat with others, you can set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too."

Just adding a few more veggies, like three extra servings each week, can boost our mood and make us happier, you know? There's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! You could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there).","I really feel animal farming is responsible for 80% of the loss of the Amazon rainforest, you know, 'cause farmers need space for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Imagine if there were no trees left here! Not at all a good picture.

But yea, by eating less meat, like choosing veggie burgers for lunch, we can make a difference without much change. If you eat with others, you can set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too."

So a year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and learned a lot along the way. It’s not about being perfect; I don’t think we all need to go completely vegan. However, being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet.

Stay tuned, as I will share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference.","Fruits and vegetables are filled with important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. You know, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. 🙂 Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could also talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together.","So, if we cut down on the meat we eat, it can help save loads of CO2, you know, the stuff that causes climate change. Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China… and back! 🙂

With little changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change right now, no need to wait for others! Let’s start small; for example, we can try to have meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms to keep animal products cheap. So on these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. 🙂

Factory farms keep going because people buy their products. If you could choose between eating less meat, and going for plant-based meats when we can, which would it be? We can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.","So, fiber is really important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and you only find it in plants, not in animal foods. When we have enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, avoiding that tired feeling after lunch. 🙂 Changing our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first. An easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon.","So, 80% of young people said they believe that living sustainably is very important for their happiness. And 77% said they would choose meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle. 🙂 It's good to see how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not trying to be completely vegan, each of us can do something to help. For example, we can try the plant-based food options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","Hey everyone here! Thanks for following along for the first week. 🙂 

I'm excited to see how more people are choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favourite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part. 

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future! 

So why not see if some of your favourite celebrities also eat plant-based?","So, cutting back on meat, dairy, and those sugary treats can really help improve acne—like, up to 87% less acne in young people! Eating lots of veggies and fruits also keeps our skin hydrated, protects us from getting sunburned, and even stops wrinkles. 🙂 Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually buy food during your day? Are there tasty plant-based options you could try the next time you have a choice?","If everyone ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change 🙂 

Climate change will mostly affect us young people because we will see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do. 

You can also find out which foods are especially harmful for the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives and never see sunlight 😞. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. This is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better 🙂.","Veggies and fruits have these awesome plant things that help our brain stay healthy and work really well. Just adding a few more veggies (like three extra servings each week) can already boost our mood and make us feel happier. 🙂

There's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! To start, you could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there).","So, animal farming is responsible for 80% of the loss of the Amazon rainforest because farmers need space for cattle and cattle food. Last year, the Amazon rainforest lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Imagine if there were not a single tree left here! 🙂 By eating less meat (like choosing veggie burgers instead of regular burgers for lunch), we can make a difference without needing to change much.

On these farms, a chicken only has like the space of a laptop, so barely any room to move. It’s like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. 

Factory farms keep going cause people buy their stuff. But if we choose to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals, ya know?","Fiber is like really important for our stomachs, it’s only in plants not animal stuff.

Every time we buy food ourselves, we decide what goes into our bodies, right? To make it more fun, why not chat with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together?","So, if we cut down on meat, we can save a lot of CO2, right? That's the stuff that causes climate change. Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it's like driving a car from London to China and back! Wild, right? 

We can all do our part with small changes like this. No need to wait for others! Let's start small, like maybe eating meat just once a day, instead of having it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. What do you think?","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms, you know, to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, right? So, hardly any room to move. It’s like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life, hmm?

Factory farms keep going because people buy their products. But, what do you think? If we choose to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals, yeah?","So, fiber, right? It’s super important for keeping our stomachs healthy. You can only find it in plants, not in animal foods. When we have enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day. No more of that tired feeling after lunch, right?

Changing our habits, like what we eat, can be a bit tricky at first. But hey, an easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school. That way, you’ll feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon. What do you think?","Yeah, so, 80% of young people think living sustainably is super important for their happiness. And, get this, 77% say they’d go for meat alternatives as part of that lifestyle! It’s awesome to see how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we’re not going full vegan, we can all do something to help, right? Like, we can try the plant-based options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often. What do you think?","Hey! Thanks for sticking around for the first week! 🙌

I’m really excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favorites like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande are vegan. Even Harry Styles and Lionel Messi are mostly avoiding animal products. 🌱

Plus, I’m seeing new plant-based products and restaurants popping up everywhere. Looks like we’ll have plenty of options in the future! 🍔

Why not check if some of your favorite celebrities are also into plant-based eating?","So, cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary stuff? It can really help with acne – like, up to 87% less for young people! Plus, loads of veggies and fruits keep your skin hydrated, protect from sunburn, and even stop wrinkles.

Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually get your food for the day? Any tasty plant-based options you could try next time?","If we all cut down on animal foods, CO2 from food production could drop by 68%! Just by changing our food choices, we’d be halfway to stopping climate change, right?

Climate change, it’s gonna hit us young people the most. Instead of being cynical, let’s look for small, effective changes we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible, it’s one of the easiest things we can do.

You can also find out which foods are especially bad for the climate. Hint: the farm animal that’s worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’.","So, most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives, right? They never see sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly, but what do you think about choosing more vegetables and meat alternatives? Like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers instead of animal meat. It's the quickest way to help make animals' lives better, right?","Veggies and fruits have these amazing plant substances that really help our brain health, you know? Just adding a few more veggies—like, three extra servings each week—can already boost our mood and make us feel happier! 😊

There's no limit to how many plants we can eat, it’s all good for our brains! You could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there). What do you think?","So, animal farming? It’s responsible for 80% of the Amazon rainforest loss, you know? Farmers need space for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Imagine if there were no trees left here! Right?

But, if we eat less meat, like choosing veggie burgers for lunch, we can make a difference. No big changes needed! Plus, if you eat with others, you can set an example, inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too. What do you think?"

Farmers need space for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Imagine if there were not a single tree left here, no, not at all! But I like veggie burgers, and by eating less meat, we can make a difference without needing to change much. If you eat with others, you can set an example too, inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices. I enjoy that, and I wonder too, who wouldn't want to make a difference?"

A year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and learned a lot along the way. It’s not about being perfect; I don't think we all need to go completely vegan lol. But being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet.

Stay tuned, I’ll share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference.","Fruits and veggies are packed with important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. Like, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall lol.

Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could also chat with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together yeah.","Cutting down on meat can save loads of CO2, which causes climate change. Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving from London to China and back! With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now, no need to wait for others! Let's start small, yeah?

On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life yeah. Factory farms keep going because people buy their products. By choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.","Fiber's super important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and you can only find it in plants, not animal foods. When we get enough fiber in our meals, we stay full longer and have more energy throughout the school day, no more feeling tired after lunch lol.

Changing habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first. An easy way to start is trying more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon.","80% of young people think living sustainably is super important for their happiness. And like 77% say they'd go for meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle lol.

It's cool to see how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not trying to be completely vegan, we can all do something to help. Like, we can try the plant-based options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often yeah.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week lol

I'm excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favourite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part.

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future!

Why don't you see if some of your favourite celebrities also eat plant-based?","Cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary stuff can seriously help with acne – like up to 87% less for young people. Eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps our skin hydrated, protects from sunburn, and even stops wrinkles lol. Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually buy food during your day? Any tasty plant-based options you could try next time?","If we all ate less animal foods, CO2 from food production would drop by 68%.

This is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better imo.","Veggies and fruits got these awesome plant things that help our brain, ya know?

Like, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. Yeah, every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together. It’s just a cool way to do things, I guess.","Hmm, I dunno... but reducing how much meat we eat can actually help save a lot of CO2, which causes climate change. Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China... and back! Yeah, it’s gonna be tricky, but with small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others! Let’s start small, you know? Like, we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.","Hmm, did you know that like, more than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms just to keep animal products cheap? Yeah, on these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there’s hardly any room to move. It’s like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. 😞

These factory farms keep going because people buy their products. But if we choose to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals. Yeah, it’s just not cool otherwise.","Hmm, I dunno if you know this, but fiber is really important for keeping our stomachs healthy. It’s only found in plants, not in animal foods. When we have enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, you know? Like, we can avoid that tired feeling after lunch.

Yeah, changing our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first. But hey, an easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school. That way, we can feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon. What do you think?","Hmm, you know, 80% of young people think living sustainably is, like, super important for their happiness. And 77% say they’d go for meat alternatives as part of that lifestyle. It’s kinda cool to see how much our generation agrees on this, you know? Even if we’re not trying to be totally vegan, each of us can do something to help. Like, we can try the plant-based options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week! 😁

I’m kinda excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my faves like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande are vegan. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, mostly avoid animal products too.

I’ve seen new plant-based products and restaurants popping up everywhere. It looks like we’ll have lots of options in the future!

Why not check if some of your favorite celebrities also eat plant-based? 🤔","Hmm, I dunno... but cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary stuff can really help with acne – like, up to 87% less for young people! And eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps our skin hydrated, protects us from sunburn, and even stops wrinkles. Yeah, having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more of that stuff. So, when do you usually buy food during your day? Are there any tasty plant-based options you could try next time?","Hmm, so like, if everyone just ate less animal stuff, we could drop CO2 from food by like 68%! Just by changing what we eat, we could be halfway to stopping climate change, you know? 😄

Climate change is gonna hit us young people the most cause we’ll see it all in our lifetime. Instead of being all cynical, let’s find small, easy changes we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when we can is one of the easiest things to do.

You can also find out which foods are super bad for the climate (hint: the farm animal that’s worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","Hmm, you know, most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives and never see sunlight. Like, animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, you know, scientists say they're much less happy. Yeah, it’s kinda sad. We might not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly, but we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives, like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers, instead of animal meat. It’s just the quickest way to help make animals' lives better, I guess.","Hmm, did you know that veggies and fruits have some cool plant stuff that's great for our brain? Like, just adding a few more veggies—maybe like three extra servings a week—can already boost our mood and make us feel happier! 😄

And the best part? You can never have too many plants, it’s all good for our brains! Maybe try challenging yourself, your friends, or even your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days. You know, with an occasional cheat day here and there. 😉","Hmm, you know, animal farming is like, responsible for 80% of the Amazon rainforest loss? They need space for cattle and their food, you see. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Imagine if there were no trees left here! That’s crazy, right?

But hey, we can make a difference just by eating less meat. Like, choosing veggie burgers instead of regular ones for lunch. Easy, right? And if you eat with others, you can set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too. Yeah, it’s that simple!"

So, a year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and learned a lot along the way. It's not about being perfect; I don't think we all need to go completely vegan, you know? But being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet, right?

Stay tuned, I'll share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference. 👍","For me, fruits and vegetables are filled with important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. But if you eat mostly plant foods, you are 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. So much, every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could also talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together.","For me, if we reduce how much meat we eat, it can help save a lot of CO2, you know, the one that causes climate change. Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China and back! With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now, no need to wait for others! Let’s start small, for example, we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.","For me, more than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms, it's to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. But these factory farms keep going because people buy their products. So if we choose to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.","For me, fiber is really important to keep our stomachs healthy, and it's only found in plants, not in animal foods. When we have enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, avoiding that tired feeling after lunch. But changing our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first. An easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon.","For me, 80% of young people believe that living sustainably is very important for their happiness. And 77% say they would choose meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle. It is good to see how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we are not trying to be completely vegan, each of us can do something to help. But for me, we can try the plant-based food options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. For me, I'm excited to see how more people are choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favourite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part. I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future! Why not see if some of your favorite celebrities also eat plant-based?","For me, reducing how much meat, dairy, and sugary foods we eat can really help improve acne, like up to 87% less acne in young people. Eating lots of vegetables and fruits also keeps our skin hydrated, protects us from getting sunburned, and even stops wrinkles. So much, having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. But when do you usually buy food during your day?

Okay, but why you don't see if some of your favorite celebrities also eat plant-based?","Honestly, cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary stuff can really make a difference with acne – like, up to 87% less for young people. Plus, loading up on veggies and fruits keeps your skin hydrated, protects from sunburn, and even fights wrinkles. I mean, who wouldn’t want clear, glowing skin just by eating more of the good stuff? So, when do you usually buy food during your day? Are there any tasty plant-based options you could try next time you have a choice?","Honestly, if everyone just ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. I mean, just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change. It's not a joke. Climate change will mostly affect us young people because we'll see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do. You can also find out which foods are especially harmful for the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’). It's not that hard, right?","Honestly, most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives, never seeing any sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, as scientists say, much less happy. We may not be able to change how these farms treat animals directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives, like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers, instead of animal meat. It's the quickest way to help make their lives better.","Honestly, vegetables and fruits have these helpful plant things that support our brain health and help it work really well. Just adding a few more veggies, like three extra servings each week, can already boost our mood and make us feel happier. There's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! To start, you could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there).","Honestly, animal farming is responsible for like 80% of the Amazon rainforest loss, you know? Farmers need space for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. I mean, imagine if there were no trees left here! It's not good.

But, by eating less meat, like choosing veggie burgers for lunch, we can make a difference without much change. If you eat with others, you can set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too. It's a good thing to do."

Is there any tasty plant-based options you could try the next time you have a choice?","Hey there, if everyone ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%.

Climate change will mostly affect us young people cause we will see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do. 🌱

You can also find out which foods are especially harmful for the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’). 🤔","Hey there, most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives and never see sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. 😞 We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. This is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better. 👍","Hey there, veggies and fruits got some real good stuff that boost our brain and make it work just fine. Just add a few more veggies, like three extra bits each week, and boom! Mood boosted, feelin' happier already. 😅

No limit to how many plants we can munch on—all good for our brains! Why not challenge yourself, your buds, or even your folks to have more plant-based meals on some days? Cheat days allowed, no worries. 😂","Hey there, animal farming is responsible for 80% of the Amazon rainforest loss cause farmers need space for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Imagine if there were no trees left! 😮

By eating less meat (like choosing veggie burgers instead of regular ones for lunch), we can make a difference without much change. If you eat with others, you can also set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too. 😊"

A year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and learned a lot along the way. It’s not about being perfect; I don’t think we all need to go completely vegan. However, being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet. 🌍

Stay tuned, as I’ll share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference. 👍","Fruits and veggies are packed with important stuff like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. Like, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could also chat with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together. Maybe you'll like it, maybe not, but worth a try!","Cutting down on meat can save loads of CO2, which is what causes climate change. Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it's like driving a car from London to China and back! Small changes like this, and everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now, no need to wait for others! Let's start small, maybe try eating meat just once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms just to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. Factory farms keep going because we buy their products. Maybe by choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.","Fiber is really important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and it's only found in plants, not in animal foods. When we have enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, avoiding that tired feeling after lunch. Changing our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first. An easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon.","80% of young people think living sustainably is super important for happiness. And 77% would go for meat alternatives for that sustainable life. It's awesome how much we agree on this. Even if we're not trying to be totally vegan, we can all do something to help. Like, we can try the plant-based stuff in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. 🎉

I'm excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favourite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part. 👍

But I'm excited to see how more people are choosing plant-based eating. Some of my fav celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part.

It brings people together. I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future!

So why not see if some of your fav celebrities also eat plant-based?","But reducing how much meat, dairy, and sugary foods we eat can really help improve acne - up to 87% less acne in young people. Eating lots of vegetables and fruits also keeps our skin hydrated, protects us from getting sunburned, and even stops wrinkles.

Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. What part of the day do you usually buy food? Are there tasty plant-based options you could try the next time you have a choice?","Hey! If we all ate less animal foods, CO2 from food would drop by 68%. Just by changing what we eat, we'd be halfway to stopping climate change, you know? Climate change is gonna affect us young people 'cause we'll see it in our lifetime. Instead of being all cynical, let's find small changes we can make now. Choosing more plant-based meals is one of the easiest things, ofcourse. You can also find out which foods are bad for the climate. Hint: the worst farm animal rhymes with 'wow'.","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives, they never see sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy though.

We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. It's one way to help make animals' lives better.","But vegetables and fruits have helpful plant substances that support our brain health, make it work well. Just adding a few more veggies, like three extra servings each week, can already boost our mood, make us feel happier. There's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! You could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there).","So, animal farming is why 80% of the Amazon rainforest is gone. Farmers need space for cattle and their food, you know. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Imagine if there were no trees left at all! But by eating less meat, like choosing veggie burgers for lunch, we can make a difference without changing much. If you eat with others, you can set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too."

About a year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and learned a lot along the way. It's not about being perfect, I don't think we all need to go completely vegan, you know? But just putting a small interest in being mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet. 🌍

So stay tuned, I'll be sharing lots of interesting science facts and giving you tips for small changes that can make a big difference. 🌱","Fruits and veggies are packed with important stuff like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. Like, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. Every time we buy food, we decide what goes into our bodies, right? To make it fun, you guys could talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together.","So, if we cut down on meat, it can save a lot of CO2, which is causing climate change. Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it's like driving a car from London to China and back! With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now, no need to wait for others! Let's start small, like trying to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. ","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms just to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life. But these factory farms keep going because people buy their products. If we choose to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.","Fiber is really important for our stomachs, it's only in plants, not in animal foods. When we have enough fiber, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, avoiding that tired feeling after lunch.

Changing our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first. But an easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school, you'll feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon.","80% of young people think living sustainably is very important for their happiness.

Climate change will mostly affect us young people cos we will see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do.

This is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better!:)","Hey! Veggies and fruits have awesome stuff that helps our brains and makes them work great! Just add a few more veggies (like three extra servings a week) and it can boost our mood and make us happier 😊

There's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains!

Animal farming is like responsible for 80% of the Amazon rainforest loss cuz they need space for cattle and their food lol :-( Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland together!
