107306,"Hey there! I’m Sasha, nice to meet you! So over the next two weeks, I'll be exploring healthy and sustainable eating with you. 😁😄😄 

A year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and learned a lot along the way. It's not about being perfect; I don't think we all need to go completely vegan. But being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet, truly. 

Stay tuned, I'll share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference.","Fruits and veggies are packed with important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. For instance, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could also talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together, it's fun!","Reducing the meat we eat can help save loads of CO2, and that's a big deal for climate change. Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China... and back! 😁

With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now, no need to wait for others! Let’s start small; for example, we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Trust me, it's fun to make a difference!","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms just to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move, it's like living under a staircase like Harry Potter for your whole life, truly. Factory farms keep going because people buy their products. I think by choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.","Fiber is truly important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and it's only found in plants, not in animal foods. When we have enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, avoiding that tired feeling after lunch. Changing our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first, I think. An easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school, it's fun and you're going to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon, trust me.","80% of young people believe living sustainably is truly important for their happiness. And 77% say they'd choose meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle, you know. 😁 It's good to see how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not trying to be completely vegan, each of us can do something to help, trust me. For example, we can try the plant-based food options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often, it's fun!","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. 😁

I'm excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating, it's fun to see! Some of my favourite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part.

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere, it's much more than just salads now! It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future!

Why not see if some of your favorite celebrities also eat plant-based, how about you? 😄","Cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary foods can truly help improve acne, up to 87% less in young people. Eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps our skin hydrated, protects us from sunburn, and even stops wrinkles. 😁

Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually buy food during your day? Are there tasty plant-based options you could try the next time you have a choice? Trust me, it's worth it!","If we all eat less animal foods, the CO2 from food production will drop by 68%, truly. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change, it's that simple!

Climate change will mostly affect us young people because we're gonna see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do, trust me.

You can also find out which foods are especially harmful for the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’ 😁😄😄)","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors all their lives, never seeing sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. 😔 We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. Trust me, it's the quickest way to help make animals' lives better. 😁","Veggies and fruits got helpful stuff that supports our brain health and helps it work well, truly. Just adding a few more veggies, like three extra servings each week, can boost our mood and make us happier! 😁😄😄

There's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! I think you should challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there), trust me, you're going to enjoy it.","Animal farming, it's responsible for 80% of the loss of the Amazon rainforest, they need space for cattle and cattle food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Imagine if there were not a single tree left here! 🤔

But by eating less meat, like choosing veggie burgers for lunch, we can make a difference without needing to change much. If you eat with others, you can set an example and inspire your friends and classmates, to be more mindful about their food choices as well, trust me. 😁"

A year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and learned a lot along the way. It's not about being perfect; I don't think we all need to go completely vegan. But being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet, truly. 

Stay tuned, I'll share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference.","Fruits and veggies are packed with important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. For instance, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could also talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together, it's fun!","Reducing the meat we eat can help save loads of CO2, and that's a big deal for climate change. Like, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China... and back! 😁

With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now, no need to wait for others! Let’s start small; for example, we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Trust me, it's fun to make a difference!","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms just to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move, it's like living under a staircase like Harry Potter for your whole life, truly. Factory farms keep going because people buy their products. I think by choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.","Fiber is truly important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and it's only found in plants, not in animal foods. When we have enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, avoiding that tired feeling after lunch. Changing our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first, I think. An easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school, it's fun and you're going to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon, trust me.","80% of young people believe living sustainably is truly important for their happiness. And 77% say they'd choose meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle, you know. 😁 It's good to see how much our generation agrees on this. Even if we're not trying to be completely vegan, each of us can do something to help, trust me. For example, we can try the plant-based food options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often, it's fun!","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. 😁

I'm excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating, it's fun to see! Some of my favourite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part.

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere, it's much more than just salads now! It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future!

Why not see if some of your favorite celebrities also eat plant-based, how about you? 😄","Cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary foods can truly help improve acne, up to 87% less in young people. Eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps our skin hydrated, protects us from sunburn, and even stops wrinkles. 😁

Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually buy food during your day? Are there tasty plant-based options you could try the next time you have a choice? Trust me, it's worth it!","If we all eat less animal foods, the CO2 from food production will drop by 68%, truly. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change, it's that simple!

Climate change will mostly affect us young people because we're gonna see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do, trust me.

You can also find out which foods are especially harmful for the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’ 😁😄😄)","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors all their lives, never seeing sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. 😔 We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly.

Yh, a year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and learned a lot along the way. It’s not about being perfect; I don't think we all need to go completely vegan. But being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet, I think. 

Stay tuned, I’ll share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference haha","Fruits and veggies are packed with important stuff like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. Like, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. 

Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies, right? To make it more fun, you could chat with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together. :) ","So, like, reducing how much meat we eat can save a lot of CO2, right? That's the stuff that causes climate change. If we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China… and back! Wild, right? 😄

With small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others! Let’s start small; for example, we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Seems fair, yeah?","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms just to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life haha.

When we have enough fiber, we stay full longer and have more energy at school, no tired feeling after lunch lol.

Try more plant-based lunches at school, feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon :) ","80% of young people think living sustainably is super important for happiness, yh? And 77% say they'd go for meat alternatives for that sustainable life :) It's great to see our generation agrees on this, even if we're not trying to be fully vegan, we can all do something to help.

Are there tasty plant-based options you could try the next time you have a choice?","If everyone ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change though.

Climate change will mostly affect us young people because we will see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, why don't you look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do though.

You can also find out which foods are especially harmful for the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives and never see sunlight though. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But why don't you choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. That's the quickest way to help make animals' lives better though.","Vegetables and fruits have helpful stuff that support our brain health and make it work well. Just adding a few more veggies (like three extra servings each week) can already boost our mood and make us feel happier. There's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! To start, why don't you challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there).","Animal farming is responsible for 80% of the Amazon rainforest loss though, farmers need space for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Imagine if there weren't a single tree left here! Not cool, right?

But hey, by eating less meat, like choosing veggie burgers instead of regular ones for lunch, we can make a difference without much change. If you eat with others, why not set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too?"
