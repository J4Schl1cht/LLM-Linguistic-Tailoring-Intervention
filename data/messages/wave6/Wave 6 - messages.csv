A year ago, I started eating more plant-based foods and learned a lot along the way. It’s not about being perfect; I don’t think we all need to go completely vegan. But being a bit mindful of how much animal food we eat and drink can be good for our health and the planet.

Stay tuned, as I'll be sharing lots of interesting science facts and giving you tips for small changes that can make a big difference.","Hey mate, fruits and veggies are packed with important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. For instance, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall. Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could also chat with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together.","Hey mate, cutting down on the meat we eat can save loads of CO2, which is causing climate change. Like, if we have meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China... and back! 🚗🌏

With little changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now, no need to wait for others! Let’s start small; like, we can try to have meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 👍","Hey mate, did you know that over 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms just to keep animal products cheap? In these places, a chicken only has about the space of a laptop, so hardly any room to move, yeah? It's like living under the stairs like Harry Potter, for your whole life, innit? These farms keep going 'cause people buy their stuff. But if we choose to eat less meat or go for plant-based stuff when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals, you know?","Hey mate, fiber is super important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and you'll only find it in plants, not in animal foods. When we've got enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for way longer and have more energy throughout the school day, so no more feeling tired after lunch, yeah?

Changing our habits, like what we eat, can be a bit tricky at first. But an easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school, you know? That way you'll feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon. 😊","Hey mate, 80% of young people reckon living sustainably is super important for their happiness, yeah? And 77% say they'd go for meat alternatives as part of their sustainable lifestyle. It's awesome to see how much our generation agrees on this, innit? Even if we're not going full vegan, each of us can do our bit to help. Like, we can give the plant-based options in our school cafeteria a shot or try some meat alternatives more often. 👍","Hey, mate! Thanks for following along for the first week. 🙌

I'm super excited to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my fave celebs eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part.

I'm also seeing new plant-based products and restaurants popping up everywhere. It looks like we'll have heaps of options in the future! 🌱

Why not check if some of your fave celebrities also eat plant-based? 🤔","Hey mate, cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary stuff can really help with acne, like up to 87% less for young folks! Plus, eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps your skin hydrated, protects you from sunburn, and even stops wrinkles. 💪 Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually grab food during your day? Are there any tasty plant-based options you could try next time you're out?","Hey mate, if everyone cut down on animal foods, CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change. 🌱

Climate change is gonna hit us young folks the hardest 'cause we'll see it all in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's find small, effective changes we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do. 👍

You can also find out which foods are especially bad for the climate (hint: the farm animal that's worst for the climate rhymes with 'wow'). 😉","Hey mate, most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives and never see sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly, but we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. This is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better.","Hey mate, have you heard that veggies and fruits have these amazing plant substances that are like, super good for our brain health? Just by adding a few more veggies, like three extra servings a week, you can already boost your mood and feel happier! 😊

There's no limit to how many plants you can eat—it's all good for our brains! Why not challenge yourself, your mates, or even your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week? A cheat day here and there is cool too, yeah? 👍","Hey mate, have you heard that animal farming is responsible for 80% of the Amazon rainforest loss? Farmers need space for cattle and cattle food, you see. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Imagine if there were no trees left here! 😮

But we can make a difference by eating less meat, like choosing veggie burgers for lunch. Easy peasy! And if you eat with others, you can set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too. 👍"

what about some of your favourite celebrities, do they eat plant-based?","eating less meat, dairy, and sugary stuff can really help with acne, like up to 87% less for young people. eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps skin hydrated, stops sunburn, and even stops wrinkles.

no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! you could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days (with a cheat day here and there).","animal farming is responsible for 80% of the amazon rainforest loss coz farmers need space for cattle and cattle food. last year, the amazon rainforest lost as many trees as there are in the uk and ireland combined. imagine if there were not a single tree left here!

by eating less meat (like choosing veggie burgers instead of regular burgers for lunch), we can make a difference without needing to change much. if you eat with others, you can also set an example and inspire your friends and classmates, to be more mindful about their food choices as well."

Stay tuned, because I'm going to share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference. 👍","Wow, fruits and veggies are packed with important nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. Did you know that people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall?

Every time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could chat with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together. What's your favourite plant-based meal?","Wow, did you know that cutting down on meat can save a lot of CO2, and that's a big deal for climate change? Like, if we have meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it's like driving a car from London to China and back! Isn't that crazy?

With small changes like this, everyone can pitch in and help the environment. We don't have to wait for others, we can start now! For example, what if we try to have meat only once a day, instead of having it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner? Sounds doable, right?","Wow, did you know more than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms just to keep animal products cheap? On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life, isn't it?

Factory farms keep going because people buy their products. But if we choose to eat less meat or go for plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals, yeah?","Wow, fiber is really important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and you can only find it in plants, not in animal foods. When we have enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, so we can avoid that tired feeling after lunch. Ha, ha. 

Changing our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first, right? But hey, an easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon. What do you think?","Wow, so 80% of young people think living sustainably is super important for their happiness. And get this, 77% say they'd go for meat alternatives to be more sustainable.

It's great to see our generation on the same page with this. Even if we're not going full vegan, we can all do our bit, you know? Like, we could try the plant-based options in our school cafeteria or swap in some meat alternatives more often. 😊","Hey! Thanks for following along for the first week. Wow, it's so exciting to see more people choosing plant-based eating. Some of my favourite celebrities eat vegan, like Lewis Hamilton, Billie Eilish, and Ariana Grande. Others, like Harry Styles and Lionel Messi, avoid animal products for the most part. I also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future! Why not see if some of your favourite celebrities also eat plant-based?","Wow, did you know that cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary foods can actually help improve acne? Like, up to 87% less acne in young people! Plus, eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps our skin hydrated, protects us from sunburn, and even stops wrinkles. Ha, ha, who knew, right? Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. So, when do you usually buy food during your day? Are there any tasty plant-based options you could try next time you have a choice?","If everyone cut down on animal foods, CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by switching up our food choices, we'd be halfway to stopping climate change. 🌎

Climate change is gonna hit us young people the hardest 'cause we'll see it happen in our lifetime. Instead of being all doom and gloom, let's look for small, effective changes we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when we can is one of the easiest things to do. 🌱

You can also find out which foods are super harmful to the climate. Hint: the farm animal that's worst for the climate rhymes with 'wow'. 🐄","Wow, did you know most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives and never see sunlight? Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly, but we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives, like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers, instead of animal meat. It's the quickest way to help make animals' lives better, don't you think?","Wow, vegetables and fruits have these amazing plant substances that really support our brain health and help it work well. Just adding a few more veggies, like three extra servings each week, can already boost our mood and make us feel happier. Haha, there's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! To start, you could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there).","Wow, did you know animal farming is responsible for 80% of the Amazon rainforest loss? Farmers need space for cattle and cattle food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Imagine if there were not a single tree left here! Ha, ha. 

But, if we eat less meat, like choosing veggie burgers instead of regular burgers for lunch, we can make a difference without needing to change much. And if you eat with others, you can set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices as well. What's your favourite veggie burger?"

I also see new plant-based products and restaurants popping up everywhere. It looks like we'll have lots of options in the future!

Why not check if some of your favourite celebrities also eat plant-based?","Cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary foods can really make a difference for acne - up to 87% less acne in young people! Plus, eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps our skin hydrated, protects us from sunburn, and even stops wrinkles. Who knew, right? Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually buy food during your day? Are there tasty plant-based options you could try the next time you have a choice?","If we all cut down on animal products, CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. Just by switching up our food choices, we'd be halfway to stopping climate change. 

Climate change is going to hit us young folks the most because we'll see its effects in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do. 

You can also check out which foods are especially bad for the climate (hint: the farm animal that's worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives and never see sunlight. It's interesting you say that! Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy.

We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. But we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. This is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better.","Vegetables and fruits have these amazing plant substances that really support our brain health and help it work well. Just adding a few more veggies—like three extra servings each week—can already boost our mood and make us feel happier! There's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! To start, you could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there).","Animal farming is behind 80% of the Amazon rainforest loss, all because farmers need space for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Imagine if there weren't a single tree left here! It's interesting to think about, isn't it? By eating less meat—like choosing veggie burgers for lunch—we can make a difference without much effort. If you eat with others, you can set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too. Who's your favourite team when it comes to saving the planet?"

so stay tuned, im gonna share lots of interesting science facts and give you tips for small changes that can make a big difference:)","fruits and veggies are packed with important stuff like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that help our bodies fight diseases. like people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get covid and have fewer hospital visits overall.

Why not see if some of your favourite celebrities also eat plant-based? 🤔","Cutting down on meat, dairy, and sugary stuff can really help with acne – like, up to 87% less acne in young people. Eating lots of veggies and fruits keeps our skin hydrated, protects from sunburn, and even stops wrinkles.

Having clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eating more veggies and fruits. When do you usually buy food during your day? Are there tasty plant-based options you could try next time you have a choice?","If everyone ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%, right? Just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change. Climate change will mostly affect us young people because we'll see its outcomes in our lifetime. Instead of being cynical, let's look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. Choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do. You can also find out which foods are especially harmful for the climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’).","Most pigs and chickens in the UK are kept indoors their whole lives, they don't even see sunlight. Animals that can't go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. We may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly, but we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives, like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers, instead of animal meat. This is the quickest way to help make animals' lives better, right?","Veggies and fruits have these helpful plant things that support our brain health and help it work well. Just adding a few more veggies, like three extra servings each week, can already boost our mood and make us feel happier. 

There's no limit to how many plants we can eat—it's all good for our brains! You could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there).","Animal farming's responsible for 80% of the Amazon rainforest loss, yeah? Farmers need space for cattle and their food. Last year, the Amazon lost as many trees as there are in the UK and Ireland combined. Imagine if there weren't a single tree left here! But, if we eat less meat, like choosing veggie burgers for lunch, we can make a difference without much change. When you eat with others, you can set an example and inspire your friends and classmates to be more mindful about their food choices too, you know?"
