For instance, people who eat mostly plant foods were 39% less likely to get Covid and have fewer hospital visits overall.\n\nEvery time we buy food ourselves, we get to decide what goes into our bodies. To make it more fun, you could also talk with your friends during lunch and try out some plant-based foods together.","Reducing how much meat we eat can help save a lot of CO2, which causes climate change. For example, if we eat meat every other day instead of every day for a year, it saves as much CO2 as driving a car from London to China… and back!\n\nWith small changes like this, everyone can help the environment and slow down climate change now without waiting for others! Let’s start small;  for example, we can try to eat meat only once a day, instead of having it at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.","More than 70% of farm animals in the UK are raised on factory farms to keep animal products cheap. On these farms, a chicken has only about the space of a laptop, so there's hardly any room to move. It's like living under a staircase, like Harry Potter, for your whole life.\n\nFactory farms keep going because people buy their products. By choosing to eat less meat or plant-based meats when we can, we can send a message to these farms to make better living conditions for their animals.","Fiber is really important for keeping our stomachs healthy, and it's only found in plants, not in animal foods. When we have enough fiber in our meals, we stay full for longer and have more energy throughout the school day, avoiding that tired feeling after lunch.\n\nChanging our habits, like what we eat, can be tricky at first. An easy way to start could be to try more plant-based lunches at school to feel more energetic and ready for the afternoon.","80% of young people believe that living sustainably is very important for their happiness.

For example, we can try the plant-based food options in our school cafeteria or some meat alternatives more often.","hey! thanks for following along for the 1st week.
i am excited to see how more people are choosing plant-based eating. some of my favorite celebrities eat vegan, like lewis hamilton, billie eilish, and ariana grande. others, like harry styles and lionel messi, avoid animal products for the most part.
i also see new plant-based products and restaurants appearing everywhere. it looks like we'll have lots of options in the future!

why not see if some of your favorite celebrities also eat plant-based? guys","reducing how much meat, dairy, and sugary foods we eat can really help improve acne (up to 87% less acne in young people). eating lots of vegetables and fruits also keeps our skin hydrated, protects us from getting sunburned, and even stops wrinkles.

havin clear, glowing skin might be as simple as just eatin more veggies and fruits. when do you guys usually buy food during your day? are there tasty plant-based options you could try the next time you have a choice?","if everyone ate less animal foods, the CO2 from food production would drop by 68%. just by changing our food choices, we could be halfway to stopping climate change

climate change will mostly affect us young people cuz we will see its outcomes in our lifetime. instead of being cynical, lets look for small, effective changes that we can make right now. choosing more plant-based meals or snacks when possible is one of the easiest things we can do

you can also find out which foods are especially harmful for to climate (hint: the farm animal that is worst for the climate rhymes with ‘wow’)","most pigs and chickens in the uk are kept indoors their whole lives and never see sunlight. animals that cant go outside are more stressed and, scientists say, much less happy. we may not be able to change how animals are treated on these farms directly. but we can choose more vegetables and meat alternatives (like plant-based schnitzel, sausages, and burgers) instead of animal meat. this is the quickest way to help make animals lives better.","vegetables and fruits have helpful plant stuff that support our brain health and help it work well. just adding a few more veggies (like 3 extra servings each week) can already boost our mood and make us feel happier.

theres no limit to how many plants we can eat—its all good for our brains! to start, you guys could challenge yourself, your friends, or your parents to have more plant-based meals on some days of the week (with an occasional cheat day here and there).","animal farming is responsible for 80% of the loss of the amazon rainforest cuz farmers need space for cattle and cattle food. last year, the amazon rainforest lost as many trees as there are in the uk and ireland combined. imagine if there were not a single tree left here!

by eating less meat (like choosing veggie burgers instead of regular burgers for lunch), we can make a difference without needing to change much. if you eat with others, you can also set an example and inspire your friends and classmates, to be more mindful about their food choices as well guys"
